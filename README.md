# Flow for Visual Studio Code

This extension adds [Flow](http://flowtype.org) support for VS Code. Flow is a static type checker, designed to find type errors in JavaScript programs.

## Installation

Follow the [instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery) for VS Code extension installation.

## Setup

* Flow is [supported](https://github.com/facebook/flow#requirements) on Mac, 64-bit Windows, and Linux, follow [flowtype.org](http://flowtype.org/docs/getting-started.html#_) to get started
* You need a `.flowconfig` in your workspace to enable the flow features
* Make sure you are able to run the `flow` command from the command line ( or you have `flow.useNPMPackagedFlow` option in `true` )
* Set workspace preference with `"javascript.validate.enable": false`.

## Configuration
You can specify a configuration by amending the VS Code `settings.json` file. Access this through Preferences -> Settings. You must reload VS Code after installing this extension for these settings to take affect.

* `flow.pathToFlow` (default: 'flow') path to Flow that will be used for VSCode or Project
* `flow.stopFlowOnExit` (default: true) stop flow server on exit from Project
* `flow.enabled` (default: true) you can disable flow for some Project for example
* `flow.useNPMPackagedFlow` (default: false) you can also run Flow by defining it in your `package.json`
* `flow.showStatus` (default: `true`) If `true` will display a spinner in the status-bar while flow is type checking.
* `flow.runOnEdit` (default: `false`) If `true` will run flow on every edit, otherwise will run only when changes are saved.

## Features

* IntelliSense
* Go to Definition / Peek Definition
* Diagnostics (Errors, Warnings)
* Hover type information
* Toggle-able Code Coverage reports

## Known Issues

* You should set workspace preference to disable default syntax validation from Visual Studio Code: `"javascript.validate.enable": false`.
* There are some aspects of Flow syntax which are not supported by the default VS Code JavaScript grammar, if you're having problems with syntax try [JavaScript Atom Grammar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.js-atom-grammar).
