This extension adds [Flow](https://flow.org/) support for VS Code. Flow is a static type checker, designed to find type errors in JavaScript programs. Follow the official guide to [get started](https://flow.org/en/docs/getting-started/).

Want to help make Flow in VS Code really shine? If this is you, you can get [set up for development](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-for-vscode/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) easily.

## Installation

Search for "Flow Language Support" in the VS Code extensions panel or install through [the marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=flowtype.flow-for-vscode).

## Setup
* Make sure you have a `.flowconfig` file somewhere in your project.
* Make sure you are able to run the `flow` command from the command line (or see [Configuration](#configuration) to customize the command or use NPM packaged flow).
* Set `javascript.validate.enable` option to `false` **or** completely disable the built-in TypeScript extension for your project (see gif below):

</p>

* If you install Flow via `flow-bin` (recommended), then we will by default try to use this installation of flow by looking for it in `node_modules`. This behavior can be disabled by setting the `flow.useNPMPackagedFlow` setting to `false`.
* If you install Flow globally (for example, `npm install -g flow-bin`), make sure `flow` is available on your `PATH`. If neither are true, then a version bundled with this extension will be used, but this is discouraged as it may change over time.

## Configuration
You can specify a configuration by amending the VS Code `settings.json` file. Access this through Preferences ‚Üí Settings. You must reload VS Code after installing this extension for these settings to take effect.

* `flow.useNPMPackagedFlow` (default: true) allows using flow from your node_modules for VSCode. 
  > **Note:** Plugin will look for node_modules in `flowconfigDir` and root of `workspaceFolder`

* `flow.pathToFlow` (default: 'flow') Absolute path to flow binary.
  ```javascript
    {
      // You can use ${workspaceFolder} it will be replaced by workspaceFolder path
      "flow.pathToFlow": "${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/.bin/flow"

      // You can also use var ${flowconfigDir} it will be replaced by flowconfigDir path
      "flow.pathToFlow": "${flowconfigDir}/node_modules/.bin/flow"

      // or use some absolute path
      "flow.pathToFlow": "/home/test/some_path/flow"
    }
  ````
  > **Note:** Path is normalized and ".cmd" is added if needed.

* `flow.useBundledFlow` (default: true) fallback to flow bundled with this plugin if nothing else works.

* `flow.showUncovered` (default: false) If `true` will show uncovered code by default. You can also toggle it later by using command or clicking on status bar widget.

* `flow.coverageSeverity` (default: 'info'): Type coverage diagnostic severity.

* `flow.lazyMode` (default: null): to override the [lazy mode](https://flow.org/en/docs/lang/lazy-modes/). Prefer to set this in `.flowconfig` instead.

* `flow.stopFlowOnExit` (default: true) stop flow server on exit from Project.

* `flow.useCodeSnippetOnFunctionSuggest` (default: true) Complete functions with their parameter signature.

* `flow.enabled` (default: true) you can disable flow for some Project for example.
